# Aboriginal Sites in Canberra Interactive Map and List

This project is a website that showcases a map and list of Aboriginal sites in Canberra. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive experience for users. Each site is represented as a dot on the map and an entry on the list. When a dot or list item is clicked, it displays a summary of the site along with an image.

## Features

- Interactive map displaying the locations of various Aboriginal sites of interest in Canberra.
- List of Aboriginal sites for quick reference and navigation.
- Click functionality that provides detailed information and images for each site.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges in the development of this project was ensuring the map's responsiveness and maintaining its aspect ratio within the container. This subsequently made positioning the sites on the map a challenge as well, however, I was able to develop a solution that positions them relative to the map's dimensions.
